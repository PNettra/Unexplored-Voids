## Unexplored-Voids
Welcome! This is a website created created by Bailey Jeng and Nettra Leandre for Kode With Klossy's 2021 web development program. 
## The Process
Over the first week, we learned how to code a website using the IDE Replit. Over the second week, we worked with teammates to design and code a website. Most of our team ended up not being able to participate, however, and we worked on the entire project among two people. We had to scale back, and the website was less detailed than we planned for it to be. At the end, we gave a presentation on our website using PowerPoint slides we created. Despite our setbacks, our instructors and peers gave us enormous positive feedback, and they praised the unique ideas and features we implemented, such as using illustrations as buttons for navigation. In the closing ceremony, Nettra was awarded as most tenacious scholar. In the end, we learned not only how to create a website, but also how to work with others by organizing roles and the work we'd do based on our skillsets and capabilities, how to adapt in stressful and unexpected situations, and how to recognize the values of our ideas, efforts, and experiences regardless of the outcome.
